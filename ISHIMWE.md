# **Overview of what i learned in today's lesson.**
i learnt that github allows people to collaborate on projects eventhough they might be in different places around the world.
Github makes it easy for developers to track issues.this facilitates their work to try running smoothly.
now the fact that github has a community which is a platform for open source software development that acts as a space for developers to collaborate, contribute to projects and discover new ones is really mindblowing .

#**what is confusing me**
git commands may seem to take much time to grasp because of how confusing and overwhelming they seem.it requires a basic understanding so as to manage repositories effectively.
Though in the above, i said github is effective because of its collaboration feauture,reviewing and merging pull requests seem challenging and time consuming.
